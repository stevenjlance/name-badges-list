COMPANY MUGS
=================

You've just been hired at a new company called Badges. They're running an app and doing well, so there are over 200 employees with the company right now.

The holiday party is coming up, and Hamadou, the CEO, wants to print personalized coffee mugs for each of his employees with their first names on them.

He has a list with the first names of all the employees, but doesn't have time to do the organizing, so he's giving that task to you. Ultimately, he needs to know how many of each mug to order. For example, if there are three employees who are all named Sania, then you'll need to order 3 mugs with the string "Sania" printed on them.

TASK
------------
This could be a daunting task, so Hamadou has written out a series of increasingly challenging tasks for you and put them in a file called `script.js` - you can see the results by openning the console, but it won't do anything until YOU write the code.


The last task is a list of all the names and the corresponding numbers. There are about a dozen different ways you could output this information, but the most useful is probably as a JavaScript object, with the names as strings paired to the numbers of mugs you need. You will need to do some research on how to accomplish this! Here's what that might look like:
```javascript
mugCount = {
    Virginia: 4,
    Tyrell: 1,
    Maria: 3
  // Etc, until you've ordered one mug for each person in the company.
}

```
